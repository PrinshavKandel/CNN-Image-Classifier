 The CNNImageClassifier (Convolutional Neural Network Image Classifier) project aims
 to develop an AI-based image detection system capable of recognizing and classifying ob
jects in digital images with high accuracy. The system addresses the growing demand for
 automated visual recognition in applications such as security monitoring, medical imag
ing, and autonomous systems. The proposed approach utilizes a convolutional neural net
work (CNN) built with the PyTorch framework to perform feature extraction and classi
fication. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to learn distinctive image features and
 improve detection precision. A user-friendly graphical interface is designed using Tkinter,
 allowing users to upload and analyze images without requiring coding knowledge. The
 integration of NumPy and Pandas enables efficient data handling and preprocessing, while
 scikit-learn supports performance evaluation through metrics such as accuracy and pre
cision. The expected outcome is an interactive, efficient, and accurate image detection
 system that demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in real-world environ
ments.
